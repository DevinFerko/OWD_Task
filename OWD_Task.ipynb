    "### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The Code below can be used to calculate death rates of COPD victims for the United States and Uganda. Written using Jupyter Notebooks, this python script calculates based on two separate metrics, crude death rate and age-standardized death rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, I created three dictionaries; death_rates which contains a list of death rates by age group for both countries, total_pop which contains both countries and their total populations, and who_stand_pop which contains the standard population distribution by age groups according to the World Health Organizations Standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these dictionaries, the death rates are then calculated and printed for the user to view. The crude death rate code sums the death rates among all age groups then divides by the total populations, this number is multiplied by 100,000 to get the crude death rate by 100,000 people.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script then iterates through the death rates dictionary again, instead this time calculates a new death rate by adjusting the originals based on the WHO standard population distribution. Then using this adjusted rate, it calculates the age-standardized death rate by dividing the sum of adjusted rates by the sum of WHO population distribution and multiplying by 100,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "All results are printed under the code cell."
